# VS2019 New Solutions

This directory stores the closest equivalent "New Solution" or "New Project" from within VS2019 and can be compared against  *revisited* code (as described by [README.MD](../README.MD) and the [Errata](../Errata/Programming%20Windows%2C%205th%20Edition%2C%20Errata%20Addendum%20-%20Jason%20Doucette.html)) and older code contained in the CD-ROM subfolder.

## Chap01

- HelloMsg-VS2019-WinDesktopApp

  Created with File -> New Project -> Windows Desktop Application (place solution and project in same directory).
  
  This does not actually display the "Hello World!" message. This is to demonstrate what a new project now contains by default.

*Work in progress* ... further solutions will be added if and when appropriate as I progress through the book.
